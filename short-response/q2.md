# Question

Consider the React component below. Explain the three ways that we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run. For each, provide an example of the dependency array to help explain your answer.

```js
const MyComponent = ({ someProp }) => {
  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }, '???');

  return (
    <div>
      <!-- Some More JSX -->
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Answer

-The first way that we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run is by using a no dependency array. As a result the callback function passed into useEffect() will be called every time that MyComponent is re-rendered. The second way is by using a empty dependency array. This results in the callback function passed into useEffect() to be called on the initial render of MyComponent. The final way is non-empty array. The callback function passed into useEffect() is called on the change of the elements of the array (someProp, someState)
